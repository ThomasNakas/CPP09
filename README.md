For this exercise, I implemented a custom sorting algorithm based on Ford–Johnson merge-insertion sort, integrating the Jacobsthal sequence to optimize the binary insertion process. This hybrid approach enhances performance while maintaining compliance with the constraints of the exercise.

Additionally, I customized the output formatting to improve clarity and assist with the evaluation process. To support a thorough and automated review, I also developed a Bash script that tests a wide range of scenarios—including valid inputs, edge cases, and error conditions—ensuring the robustness and correctness of the program.
